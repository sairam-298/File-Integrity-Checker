# 🔐 File Integrity Checker

A simple Python project that checks if a file has been modified using SHA-256 hashing.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. You run the program to generate the SHA-256 hash of a file (`example.txt`).
2. The program compares it to the previously saved hash in `original_hash.txt`.
3. If the hash matches — the file hasn't changed ✅  
   If the hash is different — the file has been modified ⚠️
