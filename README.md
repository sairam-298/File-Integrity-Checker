# File Integrity Checker 🔐

A simple Python project to check if a file has been modified using SHA-256 hashing.

## 📄 How It Works
- Computes SHA-256 hash of `example.txt`
- Compares it to the stored hash in `original_hash.txt`
- Tells you if the file was modified

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python file_checker.py
